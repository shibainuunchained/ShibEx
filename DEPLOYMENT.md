# ShibaU Trading Platform - Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository

First, create a new GitHub repository and push your code:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: ShibaU Trading Platform with live market data"

# Add your GitHub repository remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shibau-trading-platform.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel` in your project directory
3. Follow the prompts to link to your GitHub repo
4. Deploy with `vercel --prod`

#### Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the configuration
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Environment Configuration

The app is configured to work without any environment variables, using:
- In-memory storage for all data
- Free tier APIs (CoinGecko/Binance) for live market data
- Demo user system for trading functionality

### 4. Build Configuration

The project is configured for Vercel's framework preset detection:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "functions": {
    "server/index.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

Vercel will automatically detect the Vite framework and handle the build process.

## Features Included in Deployment

✅ **Live Market Data**: Real cryptocurrency prices from CoinGecko/Binance
✅ **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket price feeds every 30 seconds  
✅ **Interactive Charts**: Working timeframe selection with live data
✅ **Balance Management**: Real balance checking for all operations
✅ **Trading System**: Long/short positions with proper margin calculations
✅ **Token Swapping**: Functional swap system with balance validation
✅ **Staking & Farming**: Working DeFi features with balance deduction
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
✅ **Demo Mode**: No external accounts needed - works immediately

## API Endpoints Available

- `GET /api/market-data` - Live cryptocurrency prices
- `GET /api/chart/:symbol/:timeframe` - Chart data for trading pairs
- `POST /api/swap` - Token swapping functionality
- `POST /api/positions` - Create trading positions
- `POST /api/stake` - Staking operations
- `POST /api/add-liquidity` - Liquidity provision
- WebSocket `/ws` - Real-time price updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Fails**: Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. **API Errors**: The app uses free tier APIs with rate limits
3. **WebSocket Issues**: WebSockets work differently on Vercel (will fallback to polling)

### Performance Notes:

- First load may take 5-10 seconds (serverless cold start)
- Chart data loads from real APIs (may have slight delays)
- WebSocket connections work in development, HTTP polling in production

## Live Demo Features

Once deployed, users can:
- View live cryptocurrency prices and charts
- Switch between different timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1D)
- Execute token swaps with balance checking
- Open trading positions (long/short) with leverage
- Stake tokens in various pools
- Provide liquidity to earn rewards
- View real-time portfolio performance

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test all functionality on the live site
2. Monitor performance and API usage
3. Consider upgrading to paid APIs for higher limits if needed
4. Add custom domain if desired
5. Set up analytics and monitoring
